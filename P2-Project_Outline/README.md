# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
As someone with ADHD, I’ve spent most of my life interested in psychology and mental health. I’ve used dozens of tools, services, and apps with no success and no better understanding of myself or what challenges me. They all seem to fit into one, or both, buckets: 1. They’re prescriptive, or 2. You have to fit your unique needs into their rigid system. Nothing that I’ve come across has ever been focused on learning about what challenges you or understanding yourself. After 32 years, I’ve never known myself better than when I started recording data based on a type of “diary card” that logs various psychological factors alongside the use of mental health tools and practices, and events. After customizing this tool in a spreadsheet format, I could immediately see what challenges I needed to focus on and what tools had a correlation with positive impact on them.

The purpose of developing this as an application is to enable others to own their psychology through data visualization and education. The diary card this is based on is built for a particular therapy and, while it could be used by anyone, the goal is to develop templates for many standard tool sets while allowing extensive customization to meet anyone’s needs. It’s important to note that nothing in this application will diagnose or prescribe anything which is why it will have the capability for a professional to gain read-only access to any number of accounts. Looking forward, it will have a robust library of tools and practices, resources for help, and numerous other features that have already been identified. 

### Features
User login: Users can create an account and log in. Each user will have their own private space with data visualization and tools.

Form customization: Users can customize the default template by adding any predefined label or creating a custom label. Users can also remove any label.

Entry form: Users can log an entry once per day. Users will be presented with their customized form.

View entries: Users can view entries day-by-day and edit or delete any past log. Edited entries will display original value beneath along with the “edited on” date.

Data visualization (Nice to have): Users can display a graph charting a limited number of metrics over a length of time. Users can add pins for events to help identify correlations.

### Technologies
Java
Spring Boot
MySQL
Hibernate
Thymeleaf templates

### What I'll Have to Learn
I think the biggest challenge here will be data visualization. It looks like Java has a bunch of pre-made classes for charts in JavaFX, so I’ll likely try that since I’m not finding a ton of options.

Getting the form to display properly when adding custom labels may be a small challenge considering how I would like it laid out.
